Well I have started my own Dev blog since that seems to be what all the cool kids are doing these days.

It is mostly going to be about what I am working on and what I find interesting so if you are here great hope you like what you see.

The title of the blog is Dev Come Later because that is what I have done. While always interested in computers I did not make that the basis of my first career. My first career was as a project manager in local councils. While this did start as enjoyable I found that I was hating my job more and more as the years went on. Looking back I see this was more about the organisation I was in rather than the job but it did make me look at alternative careers. I had always been interested in the concept of creating computer programs and coding, so went the axe fell and I was made redundant I was able to take a masters in Computer Science and start a new journey as a developer.

What I have learnt in my first few years is I basically know nothing and will probably feel this way for most of my career. While this is scary it is also exhilarating to always have something new to find out about and learn.
