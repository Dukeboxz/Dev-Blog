### How much did it cost?

Well for me it cost nothing.  At the backend of last year I signed up for Microsoft training which was to watch 2 guys going through the subject matter for fundametals for 8 hours over 2 days.  For attending this training I got a voucher for a free exam.

### Preperation 

To prepare for the exam I worked through the learning path on Microsoft Learn [website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/).  While this covered everything I found having to read page after page made my brain sleepy and so I was not able to take as much in.  So to supplement my learning I watched some Plural Sight videos which were a lot better for my audio based learning style.

All in all I think that I spent the equivalent of a few hours a day for about a week preparing for this.  While this is basic level exam the questions are not guessable so you will need to do a little bit of prep.  

One of the things that did make me have to delay the exam was getting the tech right.  I did opted to do the exam remotley using the Pearson View portal.  It was using this that I became a bit unstuck.  They require you to download software that makes changes to the registry.  A big no no as far as my works laptop was concerned so I could not use that.  Then tried my personal laptop which runs linux but Pearson Vue software does not have a linux version and my attempts to use WINE were not successful.  Eventually I had to borrow a computer to do the exam.

### Day of the Exam 

As I have mentioned I did my exam remote so on the day of the exam you have to do a bit of preperation.  You have to login and register and then they will ask you to take photos of your work space and all around you.  You will then be connected to an invigilator who will ask you to make any changes.  They were strict they told me to remove paper that was in my printer and also as a shock to me also told me to take off my head phones which caused some difficults because I was trying to hear and communicate over crappy speakers and a webcam microphone.  

Once we got through that the exam started and you get down to answering the questions.  I am obviously not able to tell you what the questios were but they did cover the whole range of topics that are put down as covered by the learning ojectives.  I had more than enough time to complete the exam and review answers that I was not sure about.  then at the end I pressed submit and within a few minutes I had been told that I had passed.  Happy Days 

### Was It Worth It

Considering I got the exam for free for me it was worth it.  For my work at least I know basics when people start taling about using Azure cloud and has been a good basis for my own experimentaition in Azure.  As always digging in to stuff in a real world environment teaches you way more that courses and tutorials.

So if you get a chance to do the exam I would say do it.
