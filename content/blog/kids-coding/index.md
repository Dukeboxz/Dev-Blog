A few years ago me and a few others started a kids code club in a local community center.  Our aim was to introduce children aged 8 - 13 to coding and technology and help them develop their skills and knowledge in those areas.  With donated equipment and with trepidation we took the plunge. Over the last few years working with a ever changing group of kids with mixed ages and abilities the experience has been very rewarding to give kids skills and enjoyment through coding.
What I did not expect though was the benefit it has given to me as a way of growing as a professional software developer as well. 
 
I just want to say at this point that you DO NOT need to be a software developer to volunteer at a code club.  You are not a teacher so you are not expected to know everything and the resources that you have mean that even if you do not know you can still work through projects with the kids and learn together. 
 
If you are interested all the information at code clubs [website](https://codeclub.org/en/get-involved) 

### 1. Makes you totally clear on basic concepts.

It is unusual in software development that you have to explain what is meant by certain terms since even the most junior dev will have heard them and know roughly what they mean.  These terms include things like loops, messages and efficiencies.  This is not the case with kids at code club so when you are trying to explain to kids why their scratch program may not be the best way to do it even though it works you have to the ideas and concepts about efficient code clear in your head so that you are able to explain it to them in a way that they can understand


### 2. Imporves you ability to spot errors and typos

The first full programming language we introduce the kids to is Python and as expected the code they type does not always run and errors are shown for particular lines.  This can be frustrating for the kids since they cannot see a problem and call you over.  9 times out of 10 it is a missing word, non capitalization on similar typo.  However when you have 5 kids wanting assistance in finding these errors your speed in scanning code for potential errors has to increase just to keep up.

### 3. Gives you enthusiasm for coding 

It's fair to say that sometimes coding, especially coding an enterprise application can be a drag.  You feel that you are doing the same page over and over again and not doing anything fun.  Seeing the kids run to get their parents to show them the simple program they have just made that lets the cat jump over the fish or something reminds you why we have got into this game.  It is the joy of making something from nothing and that just with a bit of code you can do something that you can show to people and continue to make better. 

### 4.  Gives you great ideas for side projects

The hardest part for side projects is getting started with an idea and then having the motivation to see it through to the end.  By being involved with the code club I have got ideas from either the kids or from myself ideas for projects to work on that give a need but improve my skills as well.  Examples include creating a web page for the code club where kids can check off their completed projects and get points and badges or creating a UI for a raspberry PI created arcade machine to show off the kids games. 


If this sounds intersting to you do see if there is a volunteer oportunity in your local area
